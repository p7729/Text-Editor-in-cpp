# Terminal-Based Text Editor

A lightweight, terminal-based text editor written in **C++** using the **ncurses** library.  
Inspired by editors like **Vim** and **Nano**, this editor supports essential text-editing features along with efficient handling of larger files while maintaining a minimal memory footprint.

## Inspiration:
Somehow low level techy things exite me in a different way. well, c & cpp more than anything. (also, since it was my first language and I have more practice in it.) After starting this, feels almost as if I can build anything in c/cpp.. 

## Features

- **Navigation & Editing**
  - Smooth cursor navigation (arrow keys, word-wise movement)
  - Text insertion and deletion
  - Real-time word-wrap for readability
- **Advanced Functionalities**
  - Search and replace within files
  - Dynamic window resizing with instant layout adjustment
  - Scrolling support for larger files
- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Advanced buffering mechanisms for efficient editing
  - Minimal memory usage with dynamic data structures
  - Responsive user interaction with low input-to-display latency
